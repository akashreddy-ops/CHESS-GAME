# CHESS-GAME

# ♟️ JavaScript Chess Game by Akash

This is a **fully functional Chess Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (with jQuery)**.  
It features a custom-designed chessboard, animated styling, and interactive gameplay logic to move chess pieces.  
I built this project to strengthen my JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills.
