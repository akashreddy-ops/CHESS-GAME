# CHESS-GAME

# ♟️ JavaScript Chess Game by Akash

This is a **fully functional Chess Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (with jQuery)**.  
It features a custom-designed chessboard, animated styling, and interactive gameplay logic to move chess pieces.  
I built this project to strengthen my JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills.

## 🎮 About the Project


This project recreates a simplified version of **Chess** inside the browser.  
It uses **HTML div elements** to represent each square on the chessboard, dynamically rendered and color-coded using CSS.  
The **script.js** file handles all piece logic — including movement, capturing, and turns — using JavaScript and jQuery events.
